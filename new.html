          I think you're truly amazing, and every time we talk, it feels like you light up my world a little more.
          Even though we've only met once, I canâ€™t stop thinking about how incredible you are. Your kindness, your 
          smileâ€”it all leaves a lasting impression. I know we live far apart, and sometimes it feels like you're distant, 
          but even in those moments when you don't respond or seem to ignore me, I hope you know I'm still here, thinking 
          about you and appreciating every chance I get to be close to you, no matter how small.
